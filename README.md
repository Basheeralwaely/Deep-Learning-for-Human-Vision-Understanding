In this work, we try to understand the color interpolation by recovering missing information from other channels.\
Clone the repository; install dependencies:\
1- Tensorflow-gpu\
2- Cuda\
3- Keras\
4- Open-cv\
5- python3

git clone https://github.com/Basheeralwaely/Deep-Learning-for-Human-Vision-Understanding.git  \
pip install requirements.txt

Be sure to download an image dataset. We used DIV2K data sets with 800 high-resolution training images and 100 test images.

There are thre ipynb files:\
1- train.ipynp    to build your own model from scratch\
2- test.ipynp     to test the pre-trained model\
3- Videotest      to test the pre-trained model from video or camera
